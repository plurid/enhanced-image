# Architecture


Add an image to the page using the tag `<image-text-select>` or `<img-text-select>` and passing the source of the image through the `src` or the `source` attribute, as for a regular `<img>` tag.

The image will have the text obtained from the user, from a machine process, or from both.

If the text is to be obtained from the user, there should be an `access` property to determine who has the rights to edit the text and so forth. The owner of the document obtains a key from `textselect.plurid.com/image`, and, if logged in on the document, passes it to the `<image-text-select>`.

An image could also be open-edit, everyone can add/modify text and it's placement in the image space (with a versioning system).

If it is to be generated by the machine, the `<image-text-select>` will establish a connection with `its.plurid.com`, passing the image, obtaining the text with coordinates and other data.

If the owner of the page wants to store the text in a database, s/he must pass the attribute `selfhost` to the `<image-text-select>` tag. This attribute, by default `false`, will establish the creation of a document global object `imageTextSelect` which will contain all the text, coordinates and other data of all the images from the page. The object can further be stored in the database for retrieval at a later date.

By default the text of the image will be stored on `its.plurid.com`.
