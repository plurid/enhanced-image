long description

Enhanced Image allows you to extract the text from an image so you can easily select it or click on links from the image.

You can also alter the colors of the image to make it more accessible or more pleasant to the eye (increasing contrast/saturation/lightness etc.).

In future versions you will be able to generate similar images or translate the text from the image.

The extension is based on the enhanced-image and text-select-image HTML Web Components.
